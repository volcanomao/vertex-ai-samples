    "    \"Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.\",\n",
    "    \"The gills have an adnate attachment to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The stem is 6 to 8 cm (2+3⁄8 to 3+1⁄8 in) long by 1.5 to 2 mm (1⁄16 to 3⁄32 in) thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky 'hairs' pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and pruinose (lightly dusted with powdery white granules). The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish where it has been injured. The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change.\",\n",

    "    \"Adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont–the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size. This is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism, and DNA repair and recombination. While important genes participating in the DNA to RNA transcription, protein translation and DNA/RNA replication are retained. That is, a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame (ORF) size. Thus, species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them, thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates. As the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission, intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process, resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria. This incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as Muller's ratchet phenomenon. Muller's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria. This could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host.\",\n",

    "    \"Standard 35mm photographic film used for cinema projection has a much higher image resolution than HDTV systems, and is exposed and projected at a rate of 24 frames per second (frame/s). To be shown on standard television, in PAL-system countries, cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of 25 frame/s, causing a speedup of 4.1 percent, which is generally considered acceptable. In NTSC-system countries, the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted, and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called 3:2 Pulldown: Over each successive pair of film frames, one is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second) and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second), giving a total time for the two frames of 1/12 of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate.\",\n",
    "    \"Maria Deraismes was initiated into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned to allow her lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and Georges Martin started a mixed masonic lodge that actually worked masonic ritual. Annie Besant spread the phenomenon to the English speaking world. Disagreements over ritual led to the formation of exclusively female bodies of Freemasons in England, which spread to other countries. Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast it aside again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.\",\n",
    "    \"Excavation of the foundations began in November 1906, with an average of 275 workers during the day shift and 100 workers during the night shift. The excavation was required to be completed in 120 days. To remove the spoils from the foundation, three temporary wooden platforms were constructed to street level. Hoisting engines were installed to place the beams for the foundation, while the piers were sunk into the ground under their own weight. Because of the lack of space in the area, the contractors' offices were housed beneath the temporary platforms. During the process of excavation, the Gilsey Building's foundations were underpinned or shored up, because that building had relatively shallow foundations descending only 18 feet (5.5 m) below Broadway.\",\n",
    "    \"Dopamine consumed in food cannot act on the brain, because it cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. However, there are also a variety of plants that contain L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine. The highest concentrations are found in the leaves and bean pods of plants of the genus Mucuna, especially in Mucuna pruriens (velvet beans), which have been used as a source for L-DOPA as a drug. Another plant containing substantial amounts of L-DOPA is Vicia faba, the plant that produces fava beans (also known as 'broad beans'). The level of L-DOPA in the beans, however, is much lower than in the pod shells and other parts of the plant. The seeds of Cassia and Bauhinia trees also contain substantial amounts of L-DOPA.\",\n",

    "\n",
    "**必需参数:**\n",
    "  - **evaluation_dataset:** 包含评估示例的JSONL数据集的云存储路径列表。\n",
    "  - **task:** 以{task}@{version}形式的评估任务。任务可以是“summarization”，“question_answering”之一。版本是一个带有3位数字或“latest”的整数。例如：summarization@001或question_answering@latest。\n",
    "  - **id_columns:** 区分唯一评估示例的列。\n",
    "  - **autorater_prompt_parameters:** 将autorater提示参数映射到列或模板。期望的参数包括：\n",
    "      - inference_instruction - 执行任务的详细信息。\n",
    "      - inference_context - 执行任务所需要参考的内容。\n",
    "\n",
    "此外，我们需要指定候选模型（模型A和模型B）的预测来自何处。AutoSxS可以通过运行Vertex Batch Prediction来获取预测值，或者可以在评估数据集中提供预定义的预测列。\n",
    "\n",
    "**如果使用Batch Prediction进行模型参数设置（假设模型A）:**\n",
    "  - **model_a:** 完全合格的模型资源名称。如果指定了模型A响应，则此参数为可选参数。\n",
    "  - **model_a_prompt_parameters:** 将模型A提示模板参数映射到列或模板。对于[text-bison](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text#request_body)的情况，唯一需要的参数是`prompt`。\n",
    "  - **model_a_parameters:** 控制来自模型A的预测的参数，例如模型温度等。\n",
    "\n",
    "**如果使用自己带有的预测值进行模型参数设置（假设模型A）:**\n",
    "  - **response_column_a:** 包含模型A响应的列。如果为模型A提供了任何响应表，则此项为必需项。\n",
    "\n",
    "最后，还有一些参数可配置其他功能，例如导出判断或将判断与人类偏好数据集进行比较，以检查AutoRater与人类评分者的对齐情况。\n",
    "  - **judgments_format:** 写入判断的格式。可以是'json'或'bigquery'。\n",
    "  - **bigquery_destination_prefix:** 如果指定格式为'bigquery'，则写入判断的BigQuery表。\n",
    "  - **human_preference_column:** 包含基准真相的列。仅在用户想要检查autorater与人类偏好对齐时才需要。"
